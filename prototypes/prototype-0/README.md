# Prototype 0

This is the initial prototype developed as a strawman to test our assumptions around what is required for building a SP that meets RP needs.

Prototype 0 will be implemented as a Java application providing a minimal JSON interface without real SAML. It will simulate the ability to generate SAML AuthnRequests to Verify and process SAML Responses from Verify.

The `docs/adr` directory provides details on our current architectural decisions that we will test.

The `docs/diagrams` directory provides details diagrams describing the suggested request and response flows.
